Timberline Ice Cream & Candy was founded in 2021 by brothers, Nic and Seth Beckett. Nic and Seth moved to Flagstaff as kids in 1996 and have called Flagstaff home ever since.

During the pandemic, they went searching for Flagstaff's best ice cream, only to be left disappointed by what was available. The few ice cream options in Flag were very low quality and too corporate for either of their liking.

Nic began making ice cream using his countertop ice cream maker that his mom gifted him a few years earlier. Each batch was better than the previous batch, and they both soon realized they were on to something special.

Fast forward about a year, and Timberline Ice Cream officially opened in June 2022. Equipped with a small pushcart packed full of locally made, super-premium ice cream, the brothers attended art markets, farmer's markets, festivals, and special events throughout the summer.

The Beckett brothers also make various nut brittles using their grandmother's recipe. Every holiday season, they make nut brittle with their mom, and over the years, it has become a staple holiday treat in the Beckett household and amongst their closest friends.

Join the Beckett tradition today and share their amazing nut brittle with your friends, colleagues, and loved ones this holiday season. Or just treat yourself to their awesome, classic candy.
